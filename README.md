# The Oracle
*I thought this project was called Savor IQ.*

# Requirements
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) version 10.5.0

## Installing npm
If you haven't installed `npm` already on your machine, you can do so by 
by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) once it has been installed.

Once `nvm` has been installed, run `nvm install 10.5.0` to install the version of 
Node.js being used for this project.

# Running the project
For now, you can just navigate to the directory where you've cloned this
repository and run `npm run dev`. You may need to run `npm install` before you 
run this though if it's the first time.
